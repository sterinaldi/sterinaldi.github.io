It is also possible to perform hierarchical inferences: in this case the model used is (H)DPGMM. Differently from other DPGMM implementations relying on variational algorithms FIGARO does not require the user to specify a priori the maximum allowed number of mixture components. The required number of Gaussian distributions to be included in the mixture is inferred from the data. The *notebooks* folder contains a tutorial on how to use FIGARO for your research. Feel free to experiment with it and get in touch with me if you need any help! (Bug report is also extremely appreciated) type id_tools project_name SOLARSYSTEM project_excerpt 2PN N-body integrator img :solarsystem.png img_title Created with Midjourney date December 1 2021 post SOLARSYSTEM(https://github.com/sterinaldi/solarsystem):target=\\ _blank\\ is an N-body integrator based on the Crank-Nicolson method. Despite the name it is not specifically targeted to investigate the Solar System dynamics. Effects up to the second Post-Newtonian order are included. Inspired by and based on Francesco Geroni's Master thesis. type id_projects project_name Star clusters in phase space project_excerpt Daniele Sanfratello's Master thesis img :pleiades.jpg img_title Pleiades cluster. Credit: Miodrag Sekulic date May 2022 post Star clusters are groups of gravitationally bound stars which often share a common origin. These objects especially globular clusters are extremely useful for stellar evolution studies: the stars in them are of the same age and being formed from the same environment have also the same metallicity. All the evolutionary differences that can be found among stars in these clusters are to be ascribed to the different masses. Therefore they are useful to tune the physical and initial parameters for stellar evolution. In general setting aside special cases like binary systems direct mass age or metallicity measurements are very imprecise or even impossible to obtain without assuming some kind of evolutionary model. Without these quantities it is not possible to use the full definition give above to identify a star cluster. What we can rely on to observationally define a star cluster is its dynamical properties alone: we define a star cluster as a group of stars in the phase space hence spatially close and with the same proper motion. We are investigating the possibility of identifying star clusters in phase space by modelling the position and velocity distribution of stars with a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DPGMM). Day-to-day supervision with Walter Del Pozzo and Veronica Roccatagliata. type id_projects project_name GW detector selection function project_excerpt Sensitivity estimate of search pipelines img :lensing.png img_title Created with Midjourney date Oct 2022 post Despite GW interferometers being *the quietest places in the world* gravitational wave signals are buried in noise: this is due to the fact that the spacetime deformations produced by two merging black holes are extremely tiny. We are able to detect only the loudest of these events: most of them unfortunately are too faint even for our detectors. Understanding the sensitivity of our detectors to different values of black hole parameters (masses distance spins...) is of the greatest importance for population studies. A proper characterisation of this response function allows us to avoid the so-called *selection bias*. This study aims at characterising the response of our detector network and search pipelines using a dedicated set of injections following the LVK O3 search sensitivity estimates(https://zenodo.org/record/5546676#.Y2ebZC8w1hF). In collaboration with Elisa Nitoglia Walter Del Pozzo Viola Sordini and Roberto Chierici. type id_projects project_name GW lensing project_excerpt Posterior overlap analysis and non-parametric population img :gwlensed.jpg img_title Artist's impression of lensed gravitational waves. Credits: Riccardo Buscicchio (University of Birmingham). date Jan 28 2022 post General relativity posits that massive objects bend the spacetime in a way that focuses the light travel near them and causes gravitational lensing. Similar to electromagnetic waves gravitational waves can also be gravitationally lensed if they travel near massive astrophysical objects. The detection of lensed gravitational waves would enable a plethora of scientific pursuits such as precision tests of speed of gravity and cosmology dark matter detection and sub-arcsecond precision localisation of merging black holes. It has been forecasted that lensed gravitational waves will become detectable at design detector sensitivity assuming that the current binary black hole detections originate from stellar remnants. Consequently there has been a major effort to develop the necessary tools to detect and analyse lensing candidates. In this study we demonstrate that wrong population assumptions (e.g. choosing a wrong functional form for the mass distribution) have a huge impact on the accuracy of lensing analysis reducing the significativity of true lensed pairs and enhancing the one of lensing mimickers. This impact can be mitigated by using non-parametric methods. In collaboration with Damon H. T. Cheung Martina Toscani and Otto A. Hannuksela."

    ,"content"  : "Hi there! I am Stefano (but Ste is fine!), Ph.D. student in Astrophysics at University of Pisa. I was born in Livorno (Italy) in 1996, where I got my technical high school diploma in Electronics and Electrical Engineering. In 2020, I obtained my Master’s degree in Physics with honours in Pisa defending a thesis entitled Inference of cosmological parameters from gravitational wave observations, supervised by Walter Del Pozzo. During my Ph.D., still advised by Prof. Del Pozzo, my research interests moved towards black hole population studies: in particular, I am exploring the several possibilities offered by Bayesian non-parametric methods. I am an avid reader (but no horror books please: I’m slightly squeamish…) and a volleyball player (I play as libero, the one with the different jersey). After moving to Pisa I had to switch to beach volleyball, but I take it as a sign of destiny: I was born on the seaside, after all! Research activity Most of my research activity revolve around the following question: what can we learn about astrophysical black holes from gravitational waves? An astrophysical black hole is the compact object left after the explosion of a massive star. Studying these objects is like doing archaeology, for astrophysicists: black holes provide insights into what happens to stars before their death. The gravitational signal emitted by two merging black holes offer the opportunity to directly measure the intrinsic properties of these compact objects such as their masses and their spins. Characterising the distributions of these quantities and linking massive stars with black holes will open a wonderful window on stellar evolution. Unfortunately, the theoretical understanding of astrophysical black holes is extremely limited: by now, we are relying on astrophysically inspired phenomenological models. This problem introduced me to the world of Bayesian non-parametric methods: these are powerful tools to perform inference without the need to specify a model, allowing the data to speak for themselves, and the range of possible applications is extremely wide. (H)DPGMM (a Hierarchy of Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Models) belongs to this family. If you are curious about non-parametric methods, beware: the rabbit hole is deep… I am applying these methods to the problem of inferring the astrophysical black hole population in a completely agnostic way. Are the features we observe actually of astrophysical nature? Are we biased by the fact that the number of gravitational wave observations is still relatively small? From time to time, I also work on the inference of cosmolgoical parameters: you never forget your first love… Besides gravitational waves, I like fiddling with N-body problems."
