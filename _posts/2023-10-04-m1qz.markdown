It seems like so!
<!-- outline-end --> 

At the very end of my three-years-long doctorate, and thanks to the various methods we developed in these years, we managed to show that the black hole mass grows with the distance from us in a nontrivial way!

This result, the most important in my PhD thesis, is reported in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03074.pdf). Feel free to get in touch if you have any comments!
