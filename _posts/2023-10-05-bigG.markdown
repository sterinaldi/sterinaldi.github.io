Big G is out!

After more than a year of work, I am happy to announce that our paper *Bayesian analysis of systematic errors in the determination of the constant of gravitation* is finally published!

In this paper, co-authored with Hannah Middleton (University of Birmingham), Walter Del Pozzo (University of Pisa) and Jonathan Gair (MPI-AEI Potsdam), we address the presence of possible systematics in the different experiments aimed at measuring the constant of gravitation, finding that the associated uncertanty usually quoted is significantly underestimate.

Feel free to have a look at our paper at this link: https://doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-023-12078-6
